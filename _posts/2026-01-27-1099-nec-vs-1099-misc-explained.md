<h2>Why the IRS Separates 1099-NEC and 1099-MISC</h2>

<p>
The IRS tracks <strong>service income</strong> more aggressively because it directly affects self-employment tax, Social Security, and Medicare contributions.
</p>

<p>
By separating contractor payments into 1099-NEC, the IRS improves:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Income matching accuracy</li>
  <li>Audit detection</li>
  <li>Payroll tax enforcement</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is why contractor misclassification is one of the fastest ways to trigger an IRS notice.
